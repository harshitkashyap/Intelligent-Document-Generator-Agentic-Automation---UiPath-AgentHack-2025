AI Agent Powered - Intelligent Document Generation: A Self-Adapting Framework

We propose an AI Agent Powered Intelligent Document Generation Framework that revolutionises 
document creation by eliminating the need for rigid templates and manual RPA script 
adjustments, especially when document structures evolve.

- Our Solution:

1. User-Friendly Template Designer:

We will develop a custom UiPath App (or custom activities within Studio) featuring a user-friendly, 
drag-and-drop interface.

This empowers business users to visually design document templates, defining elements like 
headings, text blocks, tables, and images.

Crucially, users will provide semantic descriptions for each element (e.g., "Customer Name," 
"Invoice Amount"), enabling the AI to understand the data's meaning, not just its position.

2. Abstracted Template Format:

The designed templates are saved in a structured, reusable format (e.g., JSON or XML). This 
creates a powerful abstraction layer, separating the document's logical structure and semantic 
meaning from its specific visual layout.

3. The UiPath AI Agent Orchestration: AI-driven UiPath Agent will then intelligently orchestrate the 
entire document generation process:

* Data Extraction: 

Direct integration with various data sources (databases, web portals, other documents) to extract 
necessary information.

* Intelligent Data Mapping: 

Using Generative AI (LLMs), the agent semantically understands the extracted data and 
dynamically maps it to the corresponding fields within the abstract template, guided by the userprovided descriptions.

* Automated Validation: 

The agent can perform checks for completeness, consistency, and logical errors in the mapped 
data before document rendering.

* Dynamic Document Rendering: 

Combines the mapped data with the template to generate the final document in required format, 
such as PDF, ensuring professional and accurate output.

- How our proposed Agentic Automation solution delivers superiority:

1. Autonomous Field Mapping: 

Our Intelligent Mapping Agent learns from layout metadata and historical mappings, to 
automatically adapt data placement to new or modified template fields. This means layout 
changes no longer break the automation.

2. Automatic Validation: 

Automatically reviews generated documents, flagging missing information or logical 
inconsistencies, ensuring quality and compliance before delivery.

3. Adaptive to Change: 

Significant layout changes only require a quick template update in the user-friendly designer 
interface, not complex and time-consuming RPA script modifications. The AI handles the 
underlying data-to-layout adaptation.

The proposed solution will transform the current rigid process into a flexible, intelligent, and 
scalable document generation system.

Key Impacts:

1. Template Independence:

- Users design templates using a drag-and-drop interface (no Excel cell dependencies).

- Structural changes require zero RPA code changes, reducing support load drastically.

2. Self-Adapting Bots:

- AI Agent intelligently maps data to template fields using semantic understandingâ€”no hardcoded 
cell references.

- Bots can automatically adjust to new or modified templates.

3. Faster Turnaround:

- Reduces document rollout time from hours/days to minutes.

- Eliminates back-and-forth between end users and RPA teams for template changes.

4. Scalability Across Domains:

- The abstract, semantic approach enables easy adaptation and scaling across a wide array of 
domains (e.g., legal, finance, procurement, HR, healthcare) and document types.

5. Increased Autonomy:

- Empowers business users to manage their document workflows.

- Shifts automation from rule-based to goal-driven using agentic behavior.

6. Reduced Errors & Support Load:

- Intelligent validation agent detects missing or mismatched fields.

- Reduces human oversight and manual correction efforts.
